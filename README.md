# Tool_Name_TBD

The Tool_Name_TBD CLI is a tool that can evaluate RESTful APIs on the basis of RESTful Design Rules. These Rules are based on the Design Rules from Mark Mass√©'s book ["REST API Design Rulebook"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/rest-api-design/9781449317904/)
Currently, Tool_Name_TBD can parse the following RESTful API description languages:

* [OpenAPI v2](https://swagger.io/specification/v2/)
* [OpenAPI v3](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification)


Tool_Name_TBD has been developed in research projects at the [Software Engineering Group](https://www.iste.uni-stuttgart.de/se) of the University of Stuttgart as a Java command-line tool. It takes the path or URL to a OpenAPI definition file as input and displays a listing of design rule violations. Optionally a markdown report file can be generated with a listing of all rule violations with additonal details and improvement suggestions.


## Design Rules

Descriptions of the implemented Design Rules can be found in our [Rule documentation](./docs/Rules/readme.md).

## Project Architecture

A detailed description of the project and implemented components can be found at [Architecture](./cli/README.md)

## General Usage Instructions

Run these commands in the root folder to build and start the tool

```bash
cd cli
# build tool
./gradlew assemble
# execute program
java -jar build/libs/cli-0.1-all.jar -h
```

## Example:

```bash
# Run with an example API from api.guru https://apis.guru
java -jar build/libs/cli-0.1-all.jar -r https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/1forge.com/0.0.1/swagger.json
```

This produces the following output:

```cli
java -jar build/libs/cli-0.1-all.jar -r https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/1forge.com/0.0.1/swagger.json

-----------------INFO ANALYSIS----------------
-----------------------------------------------

Besides the static analysis there is the dynamic analysis for which the credentials for the openapi definition need to be provided. These are not stored unless you allow it. No changes will be made to resources nor are they saved.
If you want to do the dynamic analysis, enter yes or y, if you do not want to do it, enter any other key.
[yes/no]
no
----------------------------------------------

Begin with the analysis of the file from: https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/1forge.com/0.0.1/swagger.json
