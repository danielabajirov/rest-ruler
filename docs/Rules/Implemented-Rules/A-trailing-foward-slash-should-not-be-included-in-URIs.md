## Rule Description
As the last character within a URIâ€™s path, a forward slash (/) adds no semantic value and may cause confusion. REST APIs should not expect a trailing slash and should not include them in the links that they provide to clients.[1].
The way we understand this rule is that no forward slash (/) is to be included from the end of a path segment in a URI. To enforce this rule, we check each path segment in an OpenAPI definition if it ends with a forward slash (/) and in the case of a trailing forward slash (/), throw a violation.
## Implemented
