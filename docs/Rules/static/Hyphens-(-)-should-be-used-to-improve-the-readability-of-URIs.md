## Rule Description

Description from Mass√© [1].

To make your URIs easy for people to scan and interpret, use the hyphen (-) character
to improve the readability of names in long path segments. Anywhere you would use
a space or hyphen in English, you should use a hyphen in a URI.

## Implemented

* TODO

## Implementation Details (Issue #10)

* Static implementation
* Check if a path segment can be reduced to more than one word. If yes and the path segment does not contain (-) hyphens, there is a violation
* Give the hint to use hyphens to separate words in a path segment
