## Rule Description

Description from Massé [1].

"Like a computer program’s function, a URI identifying a controller resource should be
named to indicate its action."

## Implemented

* Y

## Implementation Details (Issue #39)

### What is checked

* Currently, static implementation only
* Split every path in path segments and analyze the last one. If the last path segment contains a verb as first word, and the request is not of type 
* GET or POST then the rule is violated. The rule wants to use a verb to indicate controller actions. Controller can only be of type GET or POST.
### What is not checked

* The semantic of rule is not checked, only the syntax following the defined schema.
### Future work

* Use the description of each path to gather more information and to perform a better decision on suggestion to the user if the last path segment could
* be used as controller. For example, if the last path segment is a noun, then the rule could suggest using a verb or verb phrase to indicate the action.
