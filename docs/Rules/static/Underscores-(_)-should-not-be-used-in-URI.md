## Rule Description

Description from Massé [1].

Text viewer applications (browsers, editors, etc.) often underline URIs to provide a visual cue that they are clickable.
Depending on the application’s font, the underscore (_) character can either get partially obscured or completely hidden
by this underlining. To avoid this confusion, use hyphens (-) instead of underscores (as described in “Rule: Hyphens (-)
should be used to improve the readability of URIs” --> Link to GitHub file follows).

## Implemented

* Y

## Implementation Details (Issue #9)

### What is checked
* Currently, static implementation only
* Checks every path if it contains an underscore (_) and returns a list of violations

### What is not checked

* The parameters in curly brackets are excluded from the path and are therefore currently not checked.

### Future work

* Dynamic analysis will check the parameter input if it contains an underscore
